# Grand tour — self-updating results page

A results site for the 2026 grand tours: Tour de France, Giro d'Italia, Tour
de France Femmes and Vuelta a España. Results, start lists, routes and
weather all live in per-tour files (`data/<tour>-*.json`), so the whole site
covers all four races from one **tour-aware** codebase. Only the Vuelta is
still being raced (22 Aug – 13 Sep 2026); it keeps its own results and
weather current automatically, while the other three are finished and serve
static data.

```

`index.html` lets the visitor pick a race or open `riders.html` to search riders.
The rider-search page reads the four start lists, suggests matching names, and
groups a selected rider's available stage placings by race. The Giro's stage
placings come from its official individual order of arrival for all 21 stages.
Each tour page has a back arrow to the landing page. Race pages live under a
season folder (`2026/<race>.html`) so a future season can be added alongside
it as `2027/<race>.html` without touching the existing pages. The landing
page's design (`design_handoff_year_selection/`) already specifies a
year-picker screen in front of the race list for when a second season exists;
today, with only 2026 published, that screen is not built — `index.html`
links straight into `2026/`.

### Local development

The four race pages' own per-page logic is still plain JS, inline in each
HTML file — only the shared helpers in `src/race-page.ts` are TypeScript.
Browsers can't run `.ts` directly, so it needs a build step:

```
npm install       # once
npm run build     # compiles src/race-page.ts -> dist/race-page.js
npm run watch     # or: rebuild on every save, while editing
npm test          # runs the Vitest suite in test/ (build first)
npm run lint      # ESLint over the whole repo
npm run format    # Prettier, rewriting files in place
```

**Run `npm run lint` and `npm run format` before pushing.** PR CI gates on
both (`npm run lint` and `npm run format:check`) _before_ it builds or tests,
so an unformatted file fails the run on its own.

`dist/` is gitignored (build output, not source) — run `npm run build` after
a fresh clone before opening any page locally, or nothing will render. CI
does this automatically (see the workflows) before every deploy, so
`dist/race-page.js` is always rebuilt fresh from `src/race-page.ts`.

Pull requests run `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (lint + format check + build +
`npm test`); pushes to `main` additionally run
`.github/workflows/update-results.yml`, which fetches results/riders/weather
and deploys to Pages — its build job runs the same tests (but not lint or the
format check), and the deploy job (`needs: build`) only runs if they pass.

### Live vs. static tours

- **Vuelta a España** (`vuelta2026`) is the only _live_ tour right now: it is
  registered in the `TOURS` dict in `scripts/fetch_results.py` (scraping
  lavuelta.es) and in `scripts/fetch_weather.py`, so the scheduled workflow
  keeps `data/vuelta2026-results.json` and `data/vuelta2026-weather.json`
  current as stages are raced.
- **Tour de France** (`tdf2026`) is a _finished_ race but stays registered in
  `fetch_results.py`'s `TOURS`: the workflow still polls letour.fr for it on
  every run, but the final data never changes, so it just re-confirms the
  same result and never produces an empty commit (see "How it works" below).
- **Giro d'Italia** (`giro2026`) and **Tour de France Femmes** (`femmes2026`)
  are _finished_ and **static**: their classifications and stage winners are
  stored once in `data/<tour>-results.json` (same schema as the others) and
  never refetched, because they are **not** in `fetch_results.py`'s `TOURS`
  registry at all. (They _are_ registered in `fetch_riders.py`, which is only
  ever run by hand — see below.) Their Stages tabs (routes, distances,
  illustrative profiles) are built from a small hardcoded `stages` array in
  each page itself.

To add a live tour, register it in `fetch_results.py`'s `TOURS` (with a
source handler) and point a page at its `data/<tour>-results.json`. To add a
finished race, drop a static `data/<tour>-results.json` in place and build a
page that reads it — no script or registry entry needed.

### Giro 2026 stage-result source

`data/giro2026-results.json` includes the published individual **Order of
arrival** (`ORARR`) for stages 1–21 from the [official Giro classifications](https://www.giroditalia.it/en/classifiche/di-tappa/1/)
(replace the final stage number in the URL for each stage). Rows retain the
published position, rider name, team, nationality, time and nonzero gap, plus
the race bib from the official rider link. Rider search matches that bib to
`data/giro2026-riders.json`, including names that differ between the two
sources. Riders absent from a stage's individual classification have no row;
the search page shows `—` and explains that this does not by itself establish
a withdrawal. Stage winners and final classifications are kept as they were.

To reproduce the static backfill, install the existing Python dependencies
(`requests` and `selectolax`) and run:

```
python3 scripts/backfill_giro2026_stage_results.py
```

The command validates all 21 tables and each winner before replacing
`stageResults`. It is intentionally separate from the scheduled
`fetch_results.py` workflow.

## How it works

1. GitHub Actions runs the workflow on every push to `main` and on demand
   from the Actions tab. While the Vuelta is being raced it also runs on a
   schedule (every 15 minutes — at :07, :22, :37 and :52 — from 14:00 to
   19:59 UTC on race days, plus a light run at 06:23 UTC for late
   corrections) — see the `cron:` entries at the top of
   `.github/workflows/update-results.yml`. Those odd minutes and the
   deliberate over-scheduling are load-bearing — GitHub drops scheduled
   events under load, hardest on the hour and half-hour — so don't "tidy"
   them back to `*/30`; the workflow comment has the full story. That
   schedule block is meant to be removed once the Vuelta finishes (13 Sep
   2026), the same way it was removed after the Tour de France, so the
   workflow doesn't keep polling a site with nothing left to fetch.
2. The workflow runs `fetch_results.py`, which scrapes the official rankings
   pages of every tour in its `TOURS` registry (currently letour.fr for
   `tdf2026`, lavuelta.es for `vuelta2026`): general classification, points,
   mountains, youth and team classifications, plus the winner of every stage
   raced so far.
3. The script writes `data/<tour>-results.json` for each registered tour. If
   the content changed, the workflow commits it back to the repo.
4. GitHub Pages serves the site, and each tour page fetches the JSON for its
   tour in the browser (e.g. `2026/vuelta.html` → `fetch('../data/vuelta2026-results.json')`).
   The page therefore always shows the latest committed standings with zero
   manual intervention.

The page also **auto-selects the stage of the day** when opened (the next
stage on rest days, the final stage once the race is over).

### Cancelled stages

A stage that is called off (bad weather, a security incident, …) never gets
result pages on the organiser's site, so the scraper alone can't represent
it — left alone, it would just look like "not raced yet" forever. Instead,
`fetch_results.py` has a hand-maintained `CANCELLED_STAGES` dict, keyed by
`(tour_id, stage_no)`, mapping to a reason code:

```python
CANCELLED_STAGES = {
    ("vuelta2026", 3): "weather",
}
```

Every run applies this unconditionally — it skips fetching that stage
entirely and writes `cancelled`/`cancelledReason` onto both its
`stageWinners` and `stageResults` entries — so the flag survives the next
scrape instead of being silently overwritten. The reason code must match a
key in the page's own `cancelledReasons` translation table (in `<tour>.html`'s
`STRINGS`), which renders the localized message and lets the cancelled stage
still be picked from the results dropdown.

### Teams & riders tab

Every race page has a third tab listing every team and rider, with each
rider's current or final general-classification position and gap to the
leader/winner. All four read `data/<tour>-riders.json`, written by
`scripts/fetch_riders.py` in one shared schema — but the organisers' sites
differ enough that the script has one handler per source family:

- **letour.fr / letourfemmes.fr / lavuelta.es** (`tdf2026`, `femmes2026`,
  `vuelta2026`) — ASO's Tour sites and Unipublic's Vuelta site share the same
  template, so one `"letour"` handler covers all three. It reads the start
  list at `/en/riders`, joined to the general classification and the
  per-stage withdrawal list **by bib number**; the displayed rider names
  differ between those pages, the bib does not. A rider who left the race
  therefore carries a DNS/DNF/OTL reason and the stage.
- **giroditalia.it** (`giro2026`) — teams from `/en/squadre/` and their
  rosters from each team page, joined to the final classifications **by
  athlete-page slug**. RCS never prints bib numbers, but every rider link
  carries one as `data-destination="Rider/<bib>"` (1–8 for the first team,
  11–18 for the second, … 221–228 — the Giro's own numbering), so the riders
  still get bibs and are listed in start-list order. Withdrawals are one
  table per stage page instead of a single list, so the script walks the
  stage pages to find the stage each rider left; without a published reason
  they are all reported as DNF. Times are restated from `83:22:51` into the
  same `83h 22' 51''` form the other tours use.

The scheduled workflow runs this script too, but only for the tours whose GC
is still moving: `python scripts/fetch_riders.py tdf2026 vuelta2026`, right
after `fetch_results.py`, so each rider's position and gap tracks the results
just fetched instead of staying pinned to whatever stage the script was last
run at by hand. `giro2026` and `femmes2026` are left out — their
classifications are final, and the `giro` handler is far pricier (a request
per stage plus one per team).

Run it by hand for those two, or to pick up a start-list change the GC
refresh wouldn't catch. Re-running it rewrites nothing unless the content
actually changed, so it never produces an empty commit:

```
pip install requests selectolax
python scripts/fetch_riders.py                              # every registered tour
python scripts/fetch_riders.py tdf2026 giro2026 vuelta2026   # specific tours
```

### Routes & the stage map

Each race page's expanded stage view draws the real route on a Leaflet map,
from a per-stage GPX track in `data/<tour>-routes.json`. `scripts/fetch_routes.py`
builds that file from one of two sources per race:

- **cyclingstage.com** GPX exports (`tdf2026`, `giro2026`, `femmes2026`) — a
  public, free-to-download third-party reconstruction of the route.
- **komoot** (`vuelta2026`) — the organiser's own official komoot account
  (`lavuelta`), which is the actual GPS-recorded course rather than a
  reconstruction, and is preferred wherever the organiser publishes one.

Each track is simplified with Ramer–Douglas–Peucker so the shipped file stays
small (the map is an overview locator, not turn-by-turn nav — ~50 m of
simplification is invisible at that zoom), and stored as `[lat, lon]` pairs
rounded to 5 decimals. A stage whose route hasn't been published yet is
simply omitted; the page falls back to a straight start→finish line for it.
Unlike `fetch_results.py`, `fetch_riders.py` and `fetch_weather.py`, this
script is **not** part of the workflow — a published route doesn't change, so
it is run by hand:

```
python3 scripts/fetch_routes.py            # default: tdf2026
python3 scripts/fetch_routes.py vuelta2026
python3 scripts/fetch_routes.py all
```

### Weather

`2026/tdf.html` and `2026/vuelta.html` each show a "Race-day weather" block per
stage — actual recorded conditions (not a forecast), a daily high/low/feels
at the stage's start and finish location, sourced from Open-Meteo's free
historical archive (`archive-api.open-meteo.com`, no API key). A stage only
ever shows once its race day has fully passed, both in what gets fetched and
in what the page renders — a stage still being raced never shows a same-day,
not-yet-final reading. The Tour de France is over, so `2026/tdf.html` always
shows all 21 stages; `2026/vuelta.html` fills in day by day as the race is
run. `2026/giro.html` and `2026/femmes.html` don't have a weather block; their
tours aren't registered in `fetch_weather.py`'s `TOURS`.

`scripts/fetch_weather.py` is part of the same scheduled workflow as
`fetch_results.py` (see "How it works" above): every run, it checks each
registered tour's stage schedule against today's date (in the race's own
time zone), fetches any newly-finished stage's weather at its start/finish
coordinates (the first/last point of `data/<tour>-routes.json`, or a small
hardcoded `coords_fallback` for the handful of Tour stages that routes file
has no GPX points for), and writes `data/<tour>-weather.json`. A stage
already in that file is never re-fetched — a past day's weather doesn't
change — so most runs do nothing, and the workflow commits
`data/*-weather.json` alongside results only when something new was actually
fetched. Add another tour to the `TOURS` dict in `fetch_weather.py`, with its
stage schedule and time zone, to cover it too.

## Why letour.fr and not procyclingstats.com

The site originally scraped procyclingstats.com via the `procyclingstats`
Python package. That site sits behind Cloudflare bot protection, which
blocks plain scraper traffic — and blocks it _harder_ from GitHub Actions'
datacenter IPs than from a home network, to the point where even
`cloudscraper` (a Cloudflare-bypass library) couldn't reliably get through.
letour.fr, the official Tour de France site, serves its rankings as plain
server-rendered HTML with no such protection, so `fetch_results.py` scrapes
it directly with `requests` + `selectolax` instead — and the same approach
covers lavuelta.es too, since Unipublic's Vuelta site is built on the
identical template.

Each classification is fetched and parsed independently, so a change to
letour.fr's or lavuelta.es's HTML that breaks one table (e.g. mountains)
doesn't take down the others — check the Actions log for warnings if a table
stops updating.
